# PHP-Win32-Semaphore
Provides Semaphore to PHP 8.x under Windows.

## WHY ?

1. I'm desperatly trying to implement IPC between multiple instances of PHP on multicore system ;
2. What works under Linux does not work under Windows and vice-versa ;
3. The precompiled binaries of PHP 8.0.x and 8.1RC for Windows does not provide any semaphore extension ;
4. IMO, compiling PHP 8 under Windows is a PITA and I hate working under Windows ; (please, bring back MinGW support ! MSYS2 is great now !) ;

## Why ? (short version)

Because.
